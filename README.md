### üîç Objective

Predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (Yes/No) based on their demographic, contact, and past campaign performance data. This helps optimize telemarketing efforts, improve conversion rates, and reduce costs.

### üìÇ Dataset Overview
	‚Ä¢	Source: Marketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank.
	‚Ä¢	Train Data: 40,000 rows, 17 columns.
	‚Ä¢	Test Data: 5,211 rows, 16 columns.

### Key Features
1.Client Information:
Age, job, marital status, education, loan status, and account balance.
2.Contact Details:
Last contact type (cellular/telephone), day, month, and duration.
3.Campaign Metrics:
Number of contacts, previous outcomes (poutcome).

### üöÄ Project Workflow

1. Problem Definition

Identify customers most likely to subscribe (Yes) to reduce inefficiencies in telemarketing campaigns.

2. Data Preprocessing
   
- Handled missing values.
- Performed feature engineering (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical variables).
- Scaled numerical features for uniformity.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Subscription Trends:
- 7.24% of customers subscribed (Yes).
- Single customers had higher subscription rates (9.4%) compared to married ones (6.1%).
- Cellular contact method had a higher success rate (8.96%).
- Outlier Insights:
- Balance: Significant outliers above ‚Çπ3,216.
- Call duration: Outliers exceeding 632 seconds.

5. Model Selection
- Tested Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Final Model Chosen: Random Forest
  Balanced accuracy, interpretability, and speed.

6. Evaluation Metrics
	‚Ä¢	Accuracy: 93%
	‚Ä¢	F1-Score (Tuned): 0.37
	‚Ä¢	Precision (Yes class): 64%
	‚Ä¢	Recall (Yes class): 6%

### üìä Key Visualizations
1.	Distribution of the subscription variable (Yes/No).
2.	Subscription rates by job and education levels.
3.	Impact of previous outcomes (poutcome) on subscription likelihood.

### üí° Business Impact
	1.	Better Targeting: Focus on customers with higher balances and successful past campaign outcomes.
	2.	Cost Reduction: Reduce repetitive, ineffective calls to unresponsive customers.
	3.	Improved Efficiency: Optimize call durations to maximize engagement.

### üîß Future Scope
1. Class Imbalance Handling:
Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or cost-sensitive learning to improve recall.
2. Enhanced Features:
Introduce or transform features to improve classification performance.
3. Model Experimentation:
Explore advanced models and fine-tune hyperparameters.

### üì¶ Installation
1.	Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>


2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

‚öôÔ∏è Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for:
-- Data preprocessing
-- Model training
-- Evaluation and visualization
- Evaluate model outputs for actionable insights.
